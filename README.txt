Color Deducto is a learning activity to help children learn the art of
inductive logic through pattern recognition.


Inspiration

The initial code of Deducto was written in Perl by Jon Orwant, who
wrote it as part of this doctorial thesis on EGGG, a game generation
language, under the guidance of Walter Bender.

Walter then wrote a Javascript version for the web.

Walter wrote Color Deducto to help teach some basic color concepts.

The Deducto Activity was written by a team of engineers at SEETA
(http://seeta.in): Ashita Dadlani, Anisha Arora, Satyajeet Singh, and
Manusheel Gupta

A Glade version of Deducto was developed by Assim Deodia, Vijay
Majumadar and Satyajeet Singh under the guidance of Manusheel Gupta
and Walter Bender.

A Non-sugarized pygtk version of Deducto was developed by Naveen
Aggarwal and Pankhuri Gupta under the guidance of Manusheel Gupta and
Vijay Majumadar.

This version of Color Deducto was written from scratch by Walter in
order to better match the standard Sugar look and feel.
